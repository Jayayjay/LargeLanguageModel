What is gay,"What is gay marriage? It's one of the few areas where the question of whether or not people should have been able to obtain a marriage is an ongoing debate. But there's one thing that is clear. If that's a thing, it's very important.



If you're a gay person, you'd be surprised when someone says, ""Well we would have loved this decision. But we're gay and gay people make up a very small percentage of our population,"" but people say ""no!"" It's not.
There's a huge misconception (which we've heard in the conservative media over the past several decades), that if you're a gay person, you really have no choice just to have a marriage. How many people do you hold in your pocket for a second? And how many of the people you hold have some legal protection to protect you.
